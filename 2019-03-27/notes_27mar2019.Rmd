We discussed for-loops vs vectorisation at length. Ask us for more info if curious!

Basically, it's better not to repeat yourself too often, so that when you
change a piece of your code you have a smaller chance of forgetting to update
it somwehere else. If you find yourself copy-pasting something more than 3
times, it's time to write a function or rethink the problem!

Then we discussed how to do monte-carlo simulations moving average or loess or
sliding time-window. We'll have to get back to this!
